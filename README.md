# f1-races-widget (still in dev)
Made for personal use, but free to use, if, in any case, you have found this.
Basically, this makes 2 pictures from F1 website with static links. One picture with latest race results, and other - next race small prewiew. 

<img width="572" height="230" alt="f1_last_race" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d3761a5-0078-4634-b9a6-7eb71c482b14" />
<img width="572" height="230" alt="f1_next_race" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/deb8f99f-aac3-40ed-b701-3efa4a89c49a" />

Thus, those pictures could be used or embeded as permanent links and they will update themself after each race.
